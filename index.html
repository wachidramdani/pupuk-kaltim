                                                    Before you met me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. Peach-pink lips, yeah,
                                                    everybody stares. This is no big deal. Calling out my name. I could have rewrite
                                                    your addiction. She's got that, je ne sais quoi, you know it. Heavy is the head that
                                                    wears the crown. 'Cause, baby, you're a firework. Like thunder gonna shake the
                                                    ground.
                                                    <br>
                                                    <br>
                                                    Just own the night like the 4th of July! I’m gon’ put her in a coma. What you're
                                                    waiting for, it's time for you to show it off. Can't replace you with a million
                                                    rings. You open my eyes and I'm ready to go, lead me into the light. And here you
                                                    are. I’m gon’ put her in a coma. Come on, let your colours burst. So cover your
                                                    eyes, I have a surprise. As I march alone to a different beat. Glitter all over the
                                                    room pink flamingos in the pool.
